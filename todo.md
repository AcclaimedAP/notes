ideas:
use encrypted id as verification for clients being logged in? or randomly generated userid linked to accounts, earlier approach is less safe but easier
consider express-session

backend:
crypto of passwords + ids
look over adding documents after front end, ppl say it doesn't work?

frontend:
Login
find way to track being logged in
WYSIWYG editor site
show list of documents(only owned? all?)
